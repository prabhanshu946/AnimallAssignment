Animall Assignment

I have created an assignment which includes below functionality.

1. Created an app in MVVM with clean architecture.
2. Used API : https://storage.googleapis.com/animall.appspot.com/android-interview/employees.json to fetch the data from the server
3. Added different states while fetching data like: Loading, error and success response.
4. Managed the UI to look neat and clean.
